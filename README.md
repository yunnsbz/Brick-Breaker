# Brick Breaker Clone - Enhanced Edition

This is a **Brick Breaker** clone built in **C++**, following the *Planet Chili Beginner C++* tutorial series.

My goal is not only to replicate the base implementation but also to introduce **new features** that enhance the gameplay experience, including:

-  ✅ **Restart Option** – Quickly reset the game and try again without restarting the application.
-  **Score System** – Keep track of your progress and challenge yourself.
-  **Power-Ups** – Randomly generated power-ups add variety and prevent repetitive gameplay.
-  **Brick Types** – Different types of bricks with varying difficulty to break.
-  **Game Modes** – Special layouts with unbreakable bricks to provide a tougher challenge.

This project was primarily developed as a learning exercise to improve my **C++** skills. More features may be added in the future to further enhance the game.
